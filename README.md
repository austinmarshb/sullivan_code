Snippets of code from the game I created, "The Adventures of Sullivan" on Steam.

Written in GML (Game Maker Language) which has similarities to JavaScript and C.

There are 44,000 lines of code in the game. The files above make up the most important chunks of the game, character movement, enemy movement, spawn systems, chat boxes, camera settings etc.

If anyone is making a game through Game Maker Studio, or is curious about making a game using this engine, please feel free to take a look, use and/or learn what you can from it!

Cheers
